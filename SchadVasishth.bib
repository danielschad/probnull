@article{Parker2016,
	Abstract = {Linguistic illusions have provided valuable insights into how we mentally navigate complex representations in memory during language comprehension. Two notable cases involve illusory licensing of agreement and negative polarity items (NPIs), where comprehenders fleetingly accept sentences with unlicensed agreement or an unlicensed NPI, but judge those same sentences as unacceptable after more reflection. Existing accounts have argued that illusions are a consequence of faulty memory access processes, and make the additional assumption that the encoding of the sentence remains fixed over time. This paper challenges the predictions made by these accounts, which assume that illusions should generalize to a broader set of structural environments and a wider range of syntactic and semantic phenomena. We show across seven reading-time and acceptability judgment experiments that NPI illusions can be reliably switched ``on'' and ``off'', depending on the amount of time from when the potential licensor is processed until the NPI is encountered. But we also find that the same profile does not extend to agreement illusions. This contrast suggests that the mechanisms responsible for switching the NPI illusion on and off are not shared across all illusions. We argue that the contrast reflects changes over time in the encoding of the semantic/pragmatic representations that can license NPIs. Just as optical illusions have been informative about the visual system, selective linguistic illusions are informative not only about the nature of the access mechanisms, but also about the nature of the encoding mechanisms.},

@article{NicenboimRetrieval2018,
	Abstract = {Research on similarity-based interference has provided extensive evidence that the formation of dependencies between non-adjacent words relies on a cue-based retrieval mechanism. There are two different models that can account for one of the main predictions of interference, i.e., a slowdown at a retrieval site, when several items share a feature associated with a retrieval cue: Lewis and Vasishth's (2005) activation-based model and McElree's (2000) direct access model. Even though these two models have been used almost interchangeably, they are based on different assumptions and predict differences in the relationship between reading times and response accuracy. The activation-based model follows the assumptions of the ACT-R framework, and its retrieval process behaves as a lognormal race between accumulators of evidence with a single variance. Under this model, accuracy of the retrieval is determined by the winner of the race and retrieval time by its rate of accumulation. In contrast, the direct access model assumes a model of memory where only the probability of retrieval can be affected, while the retrieval time is constant; in this model, differences in latencies are a by-product of the possibility of backtracking and repairing incorrect retrievals. We implemented both models in a Bayesian hierarchical framework in order to evaluate them and compare them. We show that some aspects of the data are better fit under the direct access model than under the activation-based model. We suggest that this finding does not rule out the possibility that retrieval may be behaving as a race model with assumptions that follow less closely the ones from the ACT-R framework. We show that by introducing a modification of the activation model, i.e, by assuming that the accumulation of evidence for retrieval of incorrect items is not only slower but noisier (i.e., different variances for the correct and incorrect items), the model can provide a fit as good as the one of the direct access model.},

@article{CaveOfShadows,
	Abstract = {Generalized additive mixed models are introduced as an extension of the generalized linear mixed model which makes it possible to deal with temporal autocorrelational structure in experimental data. This autocorrelational structure is likely to be a consequence of learning, fatigue, or the ebb and flow of attention within an experiment (the `human factor'). Unlike molecules or plots of barley, subjects in psycholinguistic experiments are intelligent beings that depend for their survival on constant adaptation to their environment, including the environment of an experiment. Three data sets illustrate that the human factor may interact with predictors of interest, both factorial and metric. We also show that, especially within the framework of the generalized additive model, in the nonlinear world, fitting maximally complex models that take every possible contingency into account is ill-advised as a modeling strategy. Alternative modeling strategies are discussed for both confirmative and exploratory data analysis.},

@article{hannesBEAP,
	Abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models have increasingly replaced mixed-model analyses of variance for statistical inference in factorial psycholinguistic experiments. The advantages of LMMs over ANOVAs, however, come at a cost: Setting up an LMM is not as straightforward as running an ANOVA. One simple option, when numerically possible, is to fit the full variance-covariance structure of random effects (the maximal model; Barr et al., 2013), presumably to keep Type I error down to the nominal {$\alpha$} in the presence of random effects. Although it is true that fitting a model with only random intercepts may lead to higher Type I error, fitting a maximal model also has a cost: it can lead to a significant loss of power. We demonstrate this with simulations and suggest that for typical psychological and psycholinguistic data, models with a random effect structure that is supported by the data have optimal Type I error and power properties.},

	discussion in the semantic literature regarding whether or not an interpretation is
	acceptable that corresponds to this association. While the data are unclear, the issue is
	of considerable theoretical significance, as it distinguishes between the available
	theories of focus interpretation. Some theories (e.g. Rooth, 1992) predict such
	a pattern of association with focus to be impossible, while others (such as Wold,

@article{jemrsurprisal,
	Abstract = {The surprisal of a word on a probabilistic grammar constitutes a promising
	complexity metric for human sentence comprehension difficulty. Using two
	different grammar types, surprisal is shown to have an effect on fixation durations
	and regression probabilities in a sample of German readers' eye movements, the
	Potsdam Sentence Corpus. A linear mixed-effects model was used to quantify the
	effect of surprisal while taking into account unigram frequency and bigram frequency
	(transitional probability), word length, and empirically-derived word predictability;
	the so-called ‚``early'' and ``late'' measures of processing difficulty both showed
	an effect of surprisal. Surprisal is also shown to have a small but statistically
	non-significant effect on empirically-derived predictability itself. This work thus
	demonstrates the importance of including parsing costs as a predictor of comprehension
	difficulty in models of reading, and suggests that a simple identification
	of syntactic parsing costs with early measures and late measures with durations of
	post-syntactic events may be difficult to uphold.},

@article{focusHindi08,
	Abstract = {A production study is presented that investigates the effects of word order and information structural
	context on the prosodic realization of declarative sentences in Hindi. Previous work on Hindi intonation
	has shown that: (i) non-final content words bear rising pitch accents (Moore 1965, Dyrud 2001, Nair
	1999); (ii) focused constituents show greater pitch excursion and longer duration and that post-focal
	material undergoes pitch range reduction (Moore 1965, Harnsberger 1994, Harnsberger and Judge
	1996); and (iii) focused constituents may be followed by a phrase break (Moore 1965). By means of
	a controlled experiment, we investigated the effect of focus in relation to word order variation using
	1200 utterances produced by 20 speakers. Fundamental frequency (F0) and duration of constituents
	were measured in Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) and Object-Subject-Verb (OSV) sentences in different
	information structural conditions (wide focus, subject focus and object focus). The analyses indicate
	that (i) regardless of word order and focus, the constituents are in a strict downstep relationship;
	(ii) focus is mainly characterized by post-focal pitch range reduction rather than pitch raising of the
	element in focus; (iii) given expressions that occur pre-focally appear to undergo no reduction; (iv)
	pitch excursion and duration of the constituents is higher in OSV compared to SOV sentences. A
	phonological analysis suggests that focus affects pitch scaling and that word order influences prosodic
	phrasing of the constituents.},

@article{hanneetal09,
	Abstract = {Background: In addition to the canonical subject-verb-object (SVO) word order, German also allows for non-canonical order (OVS), and the case-marking system supports thematic role interpretation. Previous eye-tracking studies (Kamide et al., 2003; Knoeferle, 2007) have shown that unambiguous case information in non-canonical sentences is processed incrementally. For individuals with agrammatic aphasia, comprehension of non-canonical sentences is at chance level (Burchert et al., 2003). The trace deletion hypothesis (Grodzinsky 1995, 2000) claims that this is due to structural impairments in syntactic representations, which force the individual with aphasia (IWA) to apply a guessing strategy. However, recent studies investigating online sentence processing in aphasia (Caplan et al., 2007; Dickey et al., 2007) found that divergences exist in IWAs' sentence-processing routines depending on whether they comprehended non-canonical sentences correctly or not, pointing rather to a processing deficit explanation. 
	Aims: The aim of the current study was to investigate agrammatic IWAs' online and offline sentence comprehension simultaneously in order to reveal what online sentence-processing strategies they rely on and how these differ from controls' processing routines. We further asked whether IWAs' offline chance performance for non-canonical sentences does indeed result from guessing. 
	Methods & Procedures: We used the visual-world paradigm and measured eye movements (as an index of online sentence processing) of controls (N = 8) and individuals with aphasia (N = 7) during a sentence-picture matching task. Additional offline measures were accuracy and reaction times. 
	Outcomes & Results: While the offline accuracy results corresponded to the pattern predicted by the TDH, IWAs' eye movements revealed systematic differences depending on the response accuracy. 
	Conclusions: These findings constitute evidence against attributing IWAs' chance performance for non-canonical structures to mere guessing. Instead, our results support processing deficit explanations and characterise the agrammatic parser as deterministic and inefficient: it is slowed down, affected by intermittent deficiencies in performing syntactic operations, and fails to compute reanalysis even when one is detected.},

	Abstract = {Understanding a sentence and integrating it into the discourse depends upon the identification of its focus, which, in spoken German, is marked by accentuation. In the case of written language, which lacks explicit cues to accent, readers have to draw on other kinds of information to determine the focus.
We study the joint or interactive effects of two kinds of information that have no direct representation in print but have each been shown to be influential in the reader's text comprehension: i. the (low-level) rhythmic-prosodic structure that is based on the distribution of lexically stressed syllables, and ii. the (high-level) discourse context that is grounded in the memory of previous linguistic content.
Systematically manipulating these factors, we examine the way readers resolve a syntactic ambiguity involving the scopally ambiguous focus operator auch (engl. `too') in both oral (Experiment 1) and silent reading (Experiment 2).
The results of both experiments attest that discourse context and local linguistic rhythm conspire to guide the syntactic and, concomitantly, the focus-structural analysis of ambiguous sentences. We argue that reading comprehension requires the (implicit) assignment of accents according to the focus structure and that, by establishing a prominence profile, the implicit prosodic rhythm directly affects accent assignment.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed process theory of the moment-by-moment working-memory retrievals and associated
	control structure that subserve sentence comprehension. The theory is derived from the application
	of independently motivated principles of memory and cognitive skill to the specialized task of sentence
	parsing. The resulting theory construes sentence processing as a series of skilled associative
	memory retrievals modulated by similarity-based interference and fluctuating activation. The cognitive
	principles are formalized in computational form in the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R)
	architecture, and our process model is realized in ACT-R.We present the results of 6 sets of simulations:
	5 simulation sets provide quantitative accounts of the effects of length and structural interference on
	both unambiguous and garden-path structures. A final simulation set provides a graded taxonomy of
	double center embeddings ranging from relatively easy to extremely difficult. The explanation of center-
	embedding difficulty is a novel one that derives from the model‚{\"A}{\^o}s complete reliance on discriminating
	retrieval cues in the absence of an explicit representation of serial order information. All fits were obtained
	with only 1 free scaling parameter fixed across the simulations; all other parameters were ACT-R
	defaults. The modeling results support the hypothesis that fluctuating activation and similarity-based interference
	are the key factors shaping working memory in sentence processing. We contrast the theory
	and empirical predictions with several related accounts of sentence-processing complexity.},

	Abstract = {Discourse context has been argued to be the main factor responsible for increased processing difficulty in non-canonical order sentences: if appropriate discourse context is provided (the argument goes) both canonical and non-canonical order sentences are equally easy to process. This research suggests that this generalization may not be true across languages: the distance between arguments and verbs could affect the ease with which the former can be integrated with the latter, and sufficiently increasing this distance makes processing difficult, regardless of discourse context.},

We also provide a quantitative random-effects meta-analysis of self-paced and eyetracking reading studies. We show that the empirical evidence is only partly consistent with cue-based retrieval as implemented in the ACT-R-based model of sentence processing by Lewis \& Vasishth 2005 (LV05) and that there are important differences between the reviewed dependency types. In non-agreement subject-verb dependencies, there is evidence for inhibitory interference in configurations where the correct dependent fully matches the retrieval cues. This is consistent with the LV05 cue-based retrieval account. By contrast, in subject-verb agreement as well as in reflexive-/reciprocal-antecedent dependencies, no evidence for interference is found in configurations with a fully cue-matching subject. In configurations with only a partially cue-matching subject or antecedent, the meta-analysis revealed facilitatory interference in subject-verb agreement and inhibitory interference in reflexives/reciprocals. The former is consistent with the LV05 account, but the latter is not. Moreover, the meta-analysis revealed that  (i) interference type (proactive versus retroactive) leads to different effects in the reviewed dependency types; and (ii) the prominence of the distractor has an important impact on the interference effect. 
In sum, the meta-analysis suggests that the LV05 needs important modifications to account for (i) the unexplained interference patterns and (ii) the differences between the dependency types. More generally, the meta-analysis provides a quantitative empirical basis for comparing the predictions of competing accounts of retrieval processes in sentence comprehension.},

We present a model of cue-based retrieval in sentence processing that formalizes (i) memory accessibility (prominence) and (ii) a theory of associative cues as extensions to the ACT-R model of Lewis and Vasishth (2005). The extensions are independently motivated and, compared to the original model, enable more differentiated predictions with respect to the experimental design of individual experiments as well as differences between retrieval contexts. The predictions of the original and the extended model are compared with the results of a comprehensive Bayesian meta-analysis of published studies on retrieval interference in reflexive-/reciprocal-antecedent and subject-verb dependencies (J{\"a}ger, Engelmann, Vasishth, submitted). Quantitative simulations show that the extended model accounts for effects that are outside the scope of the original model. The results emphasize the importance of accounting for different aspects of memory accessibility, for individual study design, and context-based feature-selectivity in order to generate accurate predictions of a model of cue-based memory retrieval. The simulation results thus shed new light on the cognitive mechanisms un- derlying interference effects and should be considered in the interpretation of the available data and in the design of future experiments.},

The empirically oriented researcher will benefit from making Bayesian methods part of their statistical toolkit due to the many advantages of this framework, among them easier interpretation of results relative to research hypotheses, and flexible model specification. We present an informal introduction to the foundational ideas behind Bayesian data analysis, using, as an example, a linear mixed models analysis of data from a typical psycholinguistics experiment. We discuss hypothesis testing using the Bayes factor, and model selection using cross-validation. We close with some examples illustrating the flexibility of model specification in the Bayesian framework. Suggestions for further reading are also provided.},

@article{SafaviEtAlFrontiers2016,
	Abstract = {Delaying the appearance of a verb in a noun-verb dependency tends to increase processing difficulty at the verb; one explanation for this locality effect is decay and/or interference of the noun in working memory. Surprisal, an expectation-based account, predicts that delaying the appearance of a verb either renders it no more predictable or more predictable, leading respectively to a prediction of no effect of distance or a facilitation.  Recently, Husain et al (2014) suggested that when the exact identity of the upcoming verb is predictable (strong predictability), increasing argument-verb distance leads to facilitation effects, which is consistent with surprisal; but when the exact identity of the upcoming verb is not predictable (weak predictability), locality effects are seen. We investigated Husain et al.'s proposal using Persian complex predicates (CPs), which consist of a non-verbal element---a noun in the current study---and a verb. In CPs, once the noun has been read, the exact identity of the verb is highly predictable (strong predictability); this was confirmed using a sentence completion study. In two self-paced reading (SPR) and two eye-tracking (ET) experiments, we delayed the appearance of the verb by interposing a relative clause (Expt. 1 and 3) or a long PP (Expt. 2 and 4). 
We also included a simple Noun-Verb predicate configuration with the same distance manipulation; here, the exact identity of the verb was not predictable (weak predictability). Thus, the design crossed Predictability Strength and Distance.  We found that, consistent with surprisal, the verb in the strong predictability conditions was read faster than in the weak predictability conditions. Furthermore, greater verb-argument distance led to slower reading times;  strong predictability did not neutralize or attenuate the locality effects. As regards the effect of distance on dependency resolution difficulty, these four experiments  present evidence in favor of  working memory accounts of argument-verb dependency resolution, and against the surprisal-based expectation account of Levy (2008). However, another expectation-based measure, entropy, which was computed using the offline sentence completion data, predicts reading times in Experiment 1. We suggest that forgetting due to memory overload leads to greater entropy at the verb.},

	Abstract = {Understanding a sentence requires a working memory
	of the partial products of comprehension, so that
	linguistic relations between temporally distal parts of
	the sentence can be rapidly computed. We describe an
	emerging theoretical framework for this working
	memory system that incorporates several independently
	motivated principles of memory: a sharply limited
	attentional focus, rapid retrieval of item (but not order)
	information subject to interference from similar items,
	and activation decay (forgetting over time). A computational
	model embodying these principles provides an
	explanation of the functional capacities and severe
	limitations of human processing, as well as accounts
	of reading times. The broad implication is that the
	detailed nature of crosslinguistic sentence processing
	emerges from the interaction of general principles of
	human memory with the specialized task of language
	comprehension.},

	Abstract = {Sentences containing relative clauses are well known to be difficult to comprehend, and they have long been an arena in which to investigate the role of working memory in language comprehension.  However, recent work has suggested that relative clause processing is better described by ambiguity resolution processes than by limits on extrinsic working memory.  We investigated these alternative views with a Simple Recurrent Network (SRN) model of relative clause processing in Mandarin Chinese, which has a unique pattern of word order across main and relative clauses and which has yielded mixed results in human comprehension studies.  To assess the model's ability to generalize from similar sentence structures, and to observe effects of ambiguity through the sentence, we trained the model on several different sentence types, based on a detailed corpus analysis of Mandarin relative clauses and simple sentences, coded to include patterns of noun animacy in the various structures. The model was evaluated on16 different relative clause subtypes.  Its performance corresponded well to human reading times, including effects previously attributed to working memory overflow.  The model's performance across a wide variety of sentence types suggested that the seemingly inconsistent results in some prior empirical studies stemmed from failures to consider the full range of sentence types in empirical studies.  Crucially, sentence difficulty for the model was not simply a reflection of sentence frequency in the training set; the model generalized from similar sentences and showed high error rates at points of ambiguity. The results suggest that SRNs are a powerful tool to examine the complicated constraint-satisfaction process of sentence comprehension, and that understanding comprehension of specific structures must include consideration of experiences with other similar structures in the language.},

	partial cue-matches, which constitute a kind of similarity-based interference, can give
	rise to the intrusion of ungrammatical retrieval candidates, leading to both processing
	slow-downs and even errors of judgment that take the form of illusions of grammaticality

	Abstract = {Seven experiments using self-paced reading and eyetracking suggest that omitting the middle verb in a double centre embedding leads to easier processing in English but leads to greater difficulty in German. One commonly accepted explanation for the English pattern‚{\"A}{\^\i}based on data from offline acceptability ratings and due to Gibson and Thomas (1999)‚{\"A}{\^\i}is that working-memory overload leads the comprehender to forget the prediction of the upcoming verb phrase (VP), which reduces working-memory load. We show that this VP-forgetting hypothesis does an excellent job of explaining the English data, but cannot account for the German results. We argue that the English and German results can be explained by the parser's adaptation to the grammatical properties of the languages; in contrast to English, German subordinate clauses always have the verb in clause-final position, and this property of German may lead the German parser to maintain predictions of upcoming VPs more robustly compared to English. The evidence thus argues against language-independent forgetting effects in online sentence processing; working-memory constraints can be conditioned by countervailing influences deriving from grammatical properties of the language under study.},

A robust finding in studies on the acquisition of RCs in L2 English and other European languages is that subject-gap RCs are easier than object-gap RCs, both in production and comprehension. However, in the case of L2 Japanese studies, the picture does not seem to be as clear as in the English case. This study identifies some factors that might contribute to this situation. The results of a listening comprehension test involving reversible and nonreversible test sentences show that the five groups of learners overall found subject-gap RCs easier to process than object-gap RCs, but that their performances are poor and vary for sentence types in which no semantic cue is available to help identify the grammatical function of the overt noun phrase in RCs, yielding inconclusive results with respect to the question of whether subject-gap RCs are easier than object-gap RCs. Results indicate that when RCs are too difficult for learners to process, first language properties such as head direction, word order, and the relative order of filler and gap affect the manner in which they are interpreted.},

@article{Chen238998,
	Abstract = {In neuroimaging, the multiplicity issue may sneak into data analysis through several channels, affecting expected false positive rates (FPRs; type I errors) in diverse ways. One widely recognized aspect of multiplicity, multiple testing, occurs when the investigator fits a separate model for each voxel in the brain. However, multiplicity also occurs when the investigator conducts multiple comparisons within a model, tests two tails of a t-test separately when prior information is unavailable about the directionality, and branches in the analytic pipelines. The current practice of handling multiple testing through controlling the overall FPR in neuroimaging under the null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) paradigm excessively penalizes the statistical power with inflated type II errors. More fundamentally, the adoption of dichotomous decisions through sharp thresholding under NHST may not be appropriate when the null hypothesis itself is not pragmatically relevant because the effect of interest takes a continuum instead of discrete values and is not expected to be null in most brain regions. When the noise inundates the signal, two different types of error are more relevant than the concept of FPR: incorrect sign (type S) and incorrect magnitude (type M). In light of these considerations, we introduce a different strategy using Bayesian hierarchical modeling (BHM) to achieve two goals: 1) improving modeling efficiency via one integrative (instead of many separate) model and dissolving the multiple testing issue, and 2) turning the focus of conventional NHST on FPR into quality control by calibrating type S errors while maintaining a reasonable level of inference efficiency. The performance and validity of this approach are demonstrated through an application at the region of interest (ROI) level, with all the regions on an equal footing: unlike the current approaches under NHST, small regions are not disadvantaged simply because of their physical size. In addition, compared to the massively univariate approach, BHM may simultaneously achieve increased spatial specificity and inference efficiency. The benefits of BHM are illustrated in model performance and quality checking using an experimental dataset. In addition, BHM offers an alternative, confirmatory, or complementary approach to the conventional whole brain analysis under NHST, and promotes results reporting in totality and transparency. The methodology also avoids sharp and arbitrary thresholding in the p-value funnel to which the multidimensional data are reduced. The modeling approach with its auxiliary tools will be available as part of the AFNI suite for general use.},

		than their grammatical counterparts (Frazier, 1985; Gibson &

		overload: the claim is that the prediction for an upcoming
		verb phrase is forgotten due to memory overload, leading to an
		illusion of grammaticality (Gibson & Thomas, 1999). However,
		this memory-overload account cannot explain the recent
		finding by Vasishth, Suckow, Lewis, and Kern (2008) that in
		German no illusion of ungrammaticality occurs. We present a
		simple recurrent network model that can explain both the presence
		of the grammaticality illusion in English and its absence
		in German. We argue that the grammaticality illusion emerges
		as a function of experience with language-specific structures,
		not working memory constraints as argued for in Gibson and

distinct difficulty metrics: surprisal, which reflects the change in probabilities
across syntactic analyses as new words are integrated; and retrieval, which
quantifies comprehension difficulty in terms of working memory constraints.We
examine the predictions of both metrics using a family of dependency parsers
indexed by an upper limit on the number of candidate syntactic analyses they
retain at successive words. Surprisal models all fixation measures and regression
probability. By contrast, retrieval does not model any measure in serial
processing. As more candidate analyses are considered in parallel at each word,
retrieval can account for the same measures as surprisal. This pattern suggests an
important role for ranked parallelism in theories of sentence comprehension.},

	Abstract = {Many comprehension theories assert that increasing the distance between elements participating in a
linguistic relation (e.g., a verb and a noun phrase argument) increases the difficulty of establishing that
relation during on-line comprehension. Such locality effects are expected to increase reading times and
are thought to reveal properties and limitations of the short-term memory system that supports comprehension.
Despite their theoretical importance and putative ubiquity, however, evidence for on-line
locality effects is quite narrow linguistically and methodologically: It is restricted almost exclusively to
self-paced reading of complex structures involving a particular class of syntactic relation. We present 4
experiments (2 self-paced reading and 2 eyetracking experiments) that demonstrate locality effects in the
course of establishing subject-verb dependencies; locality effects are seen even in materials that can be
read quickly and easily. These locality effects are observable in the earliest possible eye-movement
measures and are of much shorter duration than previously reported effects. To account for the observed
empirical patterns, we outline a processing model of the adaptive control of button pressing and eye
movements. This model makes progress toward the goal of eliminating linking assumptions between
memory constructs and empirical measures in favor of explicit theories of the coordinated control of
motor responses and parsing.},

	Abstract = {A general fact about language is that subject relative clauses are easier to process than object relative clauses. Recently, several self-paced reading studies have presented surprising evidence that object relatives in Chinese are easier to process than subject relatives. We carried out three self-paced reading experiments that attempted to replicate these results. Two of our three studies found a subject-relative preference, and the third study found an object-relative advantage. Using a random effects Bayesian meta-analysis of fifteen studies (including our own), we show that the overall current evidence for the subject-relative advantage is quite strong (approximate posterior probability of a subject-relative advantage given the data: 78--80%). We argue that retrieval/integration based accounts would have difficulty explaining all three experimental results. These findings are important because they narrow the theoretical space by limiting the role of an important class of explanation---retrieval/integration cost---at least for relative clause processing in Chinese.},

@article{malsburgvasishthsub10,
	Abstract = {Which repair strategy does the language system deploy when it gets
	garden-pathed and what can regressive eye movements in reading tell us about
	reanalysis strategies?  Several influential eye-tracking studies on syntactic
	reanalysis (Frazier & Rayner 1982, Meseguer et al 2002, Mitchell et al 2008) have
	examined scanpaths---sequences of eye fixations---to answer this question.
	However, in the absence of a suitable method for analyzing scanpaths, these studies
	relied on simplified dependent measures that are arguably ambiguous and hard to
	interpret.  We address the theoretical question of repair strategy by developing
	a new method that quantifies scanpath similarity.  Our method reveals several
	distinct fixation strategies associated with reanalysis that went undetected in
	a previously published data set (Meseguer et al 2002).  One prevalent pattern
	suggests re-parsing of the sentence, a strategy that has been proposed in the
	literature (Frazier & Rayner 1982); however, readers differed tremendously in
	how they orchestrated the various fixation strategies.  Our results raise the
	possibility that the human parsing system non-deterministically adopts different
	strategies when confronted with the need to reanalyze.},

@article{VSS2010,
	Abstract = {Two Hindi eyetracking studies show that clefting a noun results in greater processing difficulty initially,
	due to the extra processing steps involved in encoding a clefted noun (e.g., for computing the
	exhaustiveness interpretation). However, this extra difficulty in encoding a clefted noun results in a
	processing advantage when the clefted noun needs to be retrieved later on in the sentence -- the clefted
	noun is retrieved faster in subsequent processing compared to its non-clefted counterpart. This effect
	is short-lived, however; it does not last beyond the current sentence. We also show that given-new
	ordering yields a processing advantage over new-given order, but this is only seen after the whole
	sentence is processed, i.e., it is a late effect that occurs after syntactic processing is completed. Finally,
	following up on work on German by Hoernig et al. (2005), we present evidence that non-canonical order
	can be processed more easily than canonical order given appropriate context.},

@article{VasishthDrenhausDnD,
	Abstract = {Three experiments (self-paced reading, eyetracking and an
	ERP study) show that in relative clauses, increasing the distance be
	tween the relativized noun and the relative-clause verb makes it more
	difficult to process the relative-clause verb (the so-called locality effect).
	This result is consistent with the predictions of several theories (Gibson 2000, Lewis and Vasishth 2005), and contradicts the recent claim
	(Levy 2008) that in relative-clause structures increasing argument-verb
	distance makes processing easier at the verb. Levy's expectation-based
	account predicts that the expectation for a verb becomes sharper as dis-
	tance is increased and therefore processing becomes easier at the verb.
	We argue that, in addition to expectation effects (which are seen in the
	eyetracking study in first-pass regression probability), processing load
	also increases with increasing distance. This contradicts Levy's claim
	that heightened expectation leads to lower processing cost. Dependency-
	resolution cost and expectation-based facilitation are jointly responsible
	for determining processing cost.},

	Abstract = {Scanpaths have played an important role in classic research on reading behavior. Nevertheless, they have largely been neglected in later research---perhaps also due to a lack of suitable analytical tools. Recently, von der Malsburg and Vasishth (2011) proposed a new measure for quantifying differences between scanpaths and demonstrated that this measure can recover effects that were missed with the traditional eyetracking measures. However, the sentences used in that study were difficult to process and scanpath effects accordingly strong. The purpose of the present study was to test the validity, sensitivity, and scope of applicability of the scanpath measure using simple sentences that are typically read straight from left to right. We derived predictions for the regularity of scanpaths from the literature on oculomotor control, sentences processing, and cognitive aging and tested these predictions using the scanpath measure and a large database of eye movements (N=230). All predictions were confirmed: sentences with short words and syntactically more difficult sentences elicited more irregular scanpaths. Also, older readers produced more irregular scanpaths than younger readers. In addition, we found an effect that was not reported earlier: syntax had a smaller influence on the eye movements of older readers than on those of young readers. We discuss this interaction of syntactic parsing cost with age in terms of shifts in processing strategies and a decline of executive control as readers age. Overall, our results demonstrate the validity and sensitivity of the scanpath measure and thus establish it as a productive and versatile tool for reading research.},

	Abstract = {Individuals with agrammatic Broca's aphasia experience difficulty when processing reversible non-canonical sentences.  Different accounts have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. The Trace Deletion account attributes this deficit to an impairment in syntactic representations, whereas others propose that the underlying structural representations are unimpaired, but sentence comprehension is affected by processing deficits, such as slow lexical activation, reduction in memory resources, slowed processing and/or intermittent deficiency,  among others. We test the claims of two processing accounts, slowed processing and intermittent deficiency, and two versions of the Trace Deletion Hypothesis, in a computational framework for sentence processing  implemented in ACT-R. The assumption of slowed processing is operationalized as slow procedural memory, so that each processing action is performed slower than normal, and intermittent deficiency as extra noise in the procedural memory, so that the parsing steps are more noisy than normal. We operationalize the Trace Deletion Hypothesis as an absence of trace information in the parse tree. To test the predictions of the models implementing these theories, we use the data from a German sentence-picture matching study reported in \citeA{Hanne-EtAl-2011}. The data consists of offline (sentence-picture matching accuracies and response times) and online (eye fixation proportions) measures. From among the models considered, the model assuming that both slowed processing and intermittent deficiency are present emerges as the best model of  sentence processing difficulty in aphasia. The modeling of individual differences suggests that, if we assume that patients have both slowed processing and intermittent deficiency, they have them in differing degrees.},

	Abstract = {Previous work (Boston et al., 2011) has shown that surprisal (Hale, 2001) and retrieval difficulty (Lewis \& Vasishth, 2005) are significant predictors of reading time in the Potsdam Sentence Corpus (PSC). It remains an open question how such measures of parsing difficulty interact with eye movement control processes (Reichle et al., 2009). We investigate this interaction using the eye movement control model EMMA (Salvucci, 2001), a serial attention shift model similar to E-Z Reader, which is integrated in the cognitive architecture ACT-R. Several simulation studies are presented that explore the possibilities of incorporating surprisal and retrieval in an ACT- R/EMMA model. The ACT-R model interacts with EMMA by shifting attention from word to word. The model includes a post-lexical integration stage inspired by Reichle et al. (2009), that triggers short regressions on high difficulty. A baseline study evaluates the performance of the latest EMMA implementation in ACT-R 6.0 on the sentences of the English Schilling Corpus, thereby replicating the original study by Salvucci (2001) in the latest version of the ACT-R architectural environment. The model reproduces effects of word frequency for gaze duration, first fixation duration, single fixation duration, and the probabilities of skipping, one fixation, and two+ fixations (mean correlation r = 0.96, RMSD = 0.220). In a second simulation the same model is applied to the German Potsdam Sentence Corpus (r = 0.89, RMSD = 0.285). Further simulations include surprisal, retrieval, and both, respectively, and are qualitatively evaluated on data of the PSC. Retrieval values (calculated by Boston, 2011, under independently motivated assumptions of ACT-R theory) are used to define the duration of the integration stage. Surprisal was tested in different configurations: (a) modulating integration time and (b) directly integrated in EMMA's equation of word encoding time. Configuration (b) is motivated by experimental and corpus work (e.g., Boston, 2011; Vasishth \& Drenhaus, 2011) suggesting that surprisal may show early effects in the eye movement record more reliably than retrieval does. Our implementation of surprisal and retrieval, although resting on simplified assumptions, enables the model to reproduce general effects of both measures on reading time as observed in the PSC data (retrieval: r = 0.67, RMSD = 0.156; surprisal[b]: r = 0.81, RMSD = 0.309). The model predictions for frequency effects improve with the incorporation of surprisal[a] (RMSD = 0.232), retrieval (RMSD = 0.200) and in a model containing both predictors (RMSD = 0.199). The overall goodness of fit for word-by-word gaze duration improves only when surprisal is included (r = 0.45, RMSD = 0.983, vs. for the baseline: r = 0.39, RMSD 0.991). This work provides a first qualitative demonstration of an integrated, flexible framework incorporating two complementary measures of parsing difficulty interacting with eye movement control on different levels. It serves as a foundational step for future work on a precise investigation of the interactions between high- level language processing and eye movements.},

	reported, Spanish sentences were read more rapidly when the content
	of the relative clause forced it to modify the first of the two NPs
	in the complex NP ("the daughter") than when it modified the second
	NP ("the colonel"). Their English translations showed no difference

	content. The results are generally consistent with the claim that
	the Late Closure parsing strategy does not apply universally across
	languages. However, we propose an alternative hypothesis, namely,
	that the Late Closure parsing strategy fails to apply across all
	phrase types within a language, and applies to relative clauses in
	neither English nor Spanish. Instead, a different principle, which

@article{Grodzinsky:1995,
	Abstract = {In this paper I propose a new, restrictive theory of Trace-Deletion in agrammatism. This theory subsumes the Trace-Deletion Hypothesis (TDH; Grodzinsky, 1984a,b, 1986, 1990), which maintains that traces are deleted from agrammatic representations and that a cognitive strategy augments the patients' performance. This claim accounts for the pattern of loss and sparing observed in these patients' comprehension of a wide variety of syntactic constructions and is thus important for our understanding of the neural representation of syntax. Yet there are reasons for revising the account and making it more precise, stemming from both recent empirical findings and new developments in the theory of syntax. The original TDH was based on observations of agrammatic comprehension of structures containing traces resulting from either NP- or Wh-movement. Nevertheless, heads (as opposed to phrasal projections) also move and leave traces behind. Head movement (of verbs, for instance) has come to play a central role in linguistic theory (which currently postulates a wider variety of empty categories than any previous theoretical framework). Recent findings suggest that verb movement is retained in agrammatism, indicating that a sweeping claim regarding the deletion of all empty categories is too strong. This motivates the first restrictive move, resulting in a theory that picks out a restricted set of traces--only those for which deficient performance is indeed observed. All other empty categories are left intact. Trace-Deletion is tied to theta-positions. The second restrictive move is motivated by two types of surprising asymmetries that have recently been discovered for agrammatic comprehenders: First, agrammatic comprehension on passives of psychological predicates provides an error pattern that distinguishes this construction from agentive passive, indicating that the deficit is tied to the thematic properties of the predicate: Second, asymmetries have been observed in agrammatic comprehension of questions and quantifiers. These findings motivate a modification of the augmentative strategy, whose domain of application is restricted to referential NPs. Thus, the new account amounts to the claim that only traces in theta-positions are deleted, and that the strategy applies to referential NPs alone. This, I argue, not only derives all the data precisely but is also conceptually superior to any previous account of agrammatism. Finally, I discuss the consequences of this account to linguistic theory, and to theories of brain/language relations.},

	Abstract = {Sentences with non-canonical wh- movement are often difficult for individuals with agrammatic Broca's aphasia to understand (, inter alia). However, the explanation of this difficulty remains controversial, and little is known about how individuals with aphasia try to understand such sentences in real time. This study uses an eyetracking while listening paradigm to examine agrammatic aphasic individuals' on-line comprehension of movement sentences. Participants' eye-movements were monitored while they listened to brief stories and looked at visual displays depicting elements mentioned in the stories. The stories were followed by comprehension probes involving wh- movement. In line with previous results for young normal listeners [Sussman, R. S., \& Sedivy, J. C. (2003). The time-course of processing syntactic dependencies: evidence from eye movements. Language and Cognitive Processes, 18, 143-161], the study finds that both older unimpaired control participants (n=8) and aphasic individuals (n=12) showed visual evidence of successful automatic comprehension of wh- questions (like "Who did the boy kiss that day at school?"). Specifically, both groups fixated on a picture corresponding to the moved element ("who," the person kissed in the story) at the position of the verb. Interestingly, aphasic participants showed qualitatively different fixation patterns for trials eliciting correct and incorrect responses. Aphasic individuals looked first to the moved-element picture and then to a competitor following the verb in the incorrect trials. However, they only showed looks to the moved-element picture for the correct trials, parallel to control participants. Furthermore, aphasic individuals' fixations during movement sentences were just as fast as control participants' fixations. These results are unexpected under slowed-processing accounts of aphasic comprehension deficits, in which the source of failed comprehension should be delayed application of the same processing routines used in successful comprehension. This pattern is also unexpected if aphasic individuals are using qualitatively different strategies than normals to comprehend such sentences, as under impaired-representation accounts of agrammatism. Instead, it suggests that agrammatic aphasic individuals may process wh- questions similarly to unimpaired individuals, but that this process often fails to facilitate off-line comprehension of sentences with wh- movement.},

	Abstract = {We conducted two eye-tracking experiments investigating the processing of the Mandarin reflexive ziji in order to tease apart structurally constrained accounts from standard cue-based accounts of memory retrieval. In both experiments, we tested whether structurally inaccessible distractors that fulfill the animacy requirement of ziji influence processing times at the reflexive. In Experiment 1, we manipulated animacy of the antecedent and a structurally inaccessible distractor intervening between the antecedent and the reflexive. In conditions where the accessible antecedent mismatched the animacy cue, we found inhibitory interference whereas in antecedent-match conditions, no effect of the distractor was observed. In Experiment 2, we tested only antecedent-match configurations and manipulated locality of the reflexive-antecedent binding (Mandarin allows non-local binding). Participants were asked to hold three distractors (animate vs. inanimate nouns) in memory while reading the target sentence. We found slower reading times when animate distractors were held in memory (inhibitory interference). Moreover, we replicated the locality effect reported in previous studies. These results are incompatible with structure-based accounts. However, the cue-based ACT-R model of Lewis and Vasishth (2005) cannot explain the observed pattern either. We therefore extend the original ACT-R model and show how this model not only explains the data presented in this article, but is also able to account for previously unexplained patterns in the literature on reflexive processing.},

The memory-based accounts predict that object relatives are easier to process than subject relatives because, in object relatives, the distance between the relative clause verb and the head  noun is shorter. By contrast, expectation-based accounts such as surprisal predict that the less frequent object relative should be harder to process. In previous studies on  Chinese relative clause comprehension, local ambiguities may have rendered a comparison  between relative clause types uninterpretable. We designed experimental materials in which no local ambiguities confound the comparison. We ran two experiments (self-paced reading  and eye-tracking) to compare reading difficulty in subject and object relatives which were  placed either in subject or object modifying position.

@article{burchertetal2012,
	Abstract = {Background: In behavioural tests of sentence comprehension in aphasia, correct and
incorrect responses are often randomly distributed. Such a pattern of chance performance
is a typical trait of Broca's aphasia, but can be found in other aphasic syndromes as well.
Many researchers have argued that chance behaviour is the result of a guessing strategy,
which is adopted in the face of a syntactic breakdown in sentence processing.
Aims: Capitalising on new evidence from recent studies investigating online sentence comprehension
in aphasia using the visual world paradigm, the aim of this paper is to review
the concept of chance performance as a reflection of a syntactic impairment in sentence
processing and to re-examine the conventional interpretation of chance performance as a
guessing behaviour.
Main Contribution: Based on a review of recent evidence from visual world paradigm
studies, we argue that the assumption of chance performance equalling guessing is not
necessarily compatible with actual real-time parsing procedures in people with aphasia.
We propose a reinterpretation of the concept of chance performance by assuming that
there are two distinct processing mechanisms underlying sentence comprehension in
aphasia. Correct responses are always the result of normal-like parsing mechanisms, even
in those cases where the overall performance pattern is at chance. Incorrect responses, on
the other hand, are the result of intermittent deficiencies of the parser. Hence the random
guessing behaviour that persons with aphasia often display does not necessarily reflect a
syntactic breakdown in sentence comprehension and a random selection between alternatives.
Instead it should be regarded as a result of temporal deficient parsing procedures
in otherwise normal-like comprehension routines.
Conclusion: Our conclusion is that the consideration of behavioural offline data alone
may not be sufficient to interpret a performance in language tests and subsequently draw
theoretical conclusions about language impairments. Rather it is important to call on
additional data from online studies that look at language processing in real time in order
to gain a comprehensive picture about syntactic comprehension abilities of people with
aphasia and possible underlying deficits.},

It remains an open question how the sentence processor interacts with oculomotor control. Using a simple linking hypothesis proposed in Reichle, Warren, and McConnell (2009), we integrated both measures with the eye movement model EMMA (Salvucci, 2001) inside the cognitive architecture ACT-R (Anderson et al., 2004). We built a reading model that could initiate short ``Time Out 
regressions'' (Mitchell, Shen, Green, & Hodgson, 2008) that compensate for slow postlexical processing. This simple interaction enabled the model to predict the re-reading of words based on parsing difficulty. The model was evaluated in different configurations on the prediction of frequency effects on the Potsdam Sentence Corpus. The extension of EMMA with postlexical processing improved its predictions and reproduced re-reading rates and durations with a reasonable fit to the data. This demonstration, based on simple and independently motivated assumptions, serves as a foundational step toward a precise investigation of the interaction between high-level language processing and eye movement control.},

significantly more difficult than present tense. Error types were

The present eye-tracking study, which investigated processing of attachment ambiguities of an adjunct in Spanish, suggests that readers sometimes underspecify attachment to save memory resources, consistent with the good-enough account of parsing. Our results confirm a surprising prediction of the good-enough account: high-capacity readers commit to an attachment decision more often than low-capacity participants, leading to more errors and a greater need to reanalyze in garden-path sentences.  These results emerged only when we separated functionally different types of regressive eye movements using a scanpath analysis; conventional eye-tracking measures alone would have led to different conclusions.  The scanpath analysis also showed that rereading was the dominant strategy for recovering from garden-pathing.  Our results may also have broader implications for models of reading processes: reanalysis effects in eye movements occurred late, which suggests that the coupling of oculo-motor control and the parser may not always be as tight as assumed in current computational models of eye movements control in reading.},

	Abstract = {In Persian, a construction exists in which a gap can optionally be replaced by an overt pronoun.  A self-paced reading study (110 participants) suggests that the overt pronoun results in deeper encoding (higher activation) of the antecedent noun, presumably because of richer retrieval cue specifications during antecedent retrieval at the pronoun; this higher activation has the consequence that the antecedent is easier to retrieve at a subsequent stage.  This provides new evidence for reactivation effects of the type assumed in the cue-based retrieval model of parsing (Lewis and Vasishth, 2005), and shows that dependency resolution is not simply a matter of connecting two co-dependents; the retrieval cue specification has a differential impact on processing.},

	Abstract = {Eye-movement research on implicit prosody has found effects of lexical stress on syntactic
ambiguity resolution, suggesting that metrical well-formedness constraints interact
with syntactic category assignment. Building on these findings, the present
eyetracking study investigates whether contextual bias can modulate the effects of
metrical structure on syntactic ambiguity resolution in silent reading. Contextual bias
and potential stress-clash in the ambiguous region were crossed in a 2 × 2 design.
Participants read biased context sentences followed by temporarily ambiguous test
sentences. In the three-word ambiguous region, main effects of lexical stress were
dominant, while early effects of context were absent. Potential stress clash yielded
a significant increase in first-pass regressions and re-reading probability across the
three words. In the disambiguating region, the disambiguating word itself showed
increased processing difficulty (lower skipping and increased re-reading probability)
when the disambiguation engendered a stress clash configuration, while the word
immediately following showed main effects of context in those same measures. Taken
together, effects of lexical stress upon eye movements were swift and pervasive across
first-pass and second-pass measures, while effects of context were relatively delayed.
These results indicate a strong role for implicit meter in guiding parsing, one that
appears insensitive to higher-level constraints. Our findings are problematic for
two classes of models, the two-stage garden-path model and the constraint-based
competition-integration model, but can be explained by a variation on the two-stage
model, the unrestricted race model.},

	Abstract = {Reichle et al. (Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review, 2009) proposed two kinds of interaction between post-lexical processing and oculomotor control: (1) "slow integration failure": A time-out regression when post-lexical integration is lagged; and (2) "rapid integration failure": A regression when integration fails. Boston et al. (Eye Movement Research, 2008; Language and Cognitive Processes, 2011) showed that memory retrieval (Lewis \& Vasishth, Cognitive Science, 2005) and syntactic surprisal (Hale, NAACL, 2001; Levy, Cognition, 2008) are significant predictors of eye movements in the Potsdam Sentence Corpus. We implemented the proposed interaction of the first kind in the cognitive architecture ACT-R and evaluated the model on the Potsdam Sentence Corpus using pre-calculated values from Boston et al. (2008, 2011). The model's prediction of 11 fixation measures including second-pass durations and regression rates was grouped by classes of word frequency and fitted to the data with a resulting root-mean-square error of 0.206 and a correlation R of 0.9. Based on this evaluation we present work in progress that uses the parser of Lewis \& Vasishth (2005) for a direct interaction of eye movement control with parsing rules and implements rapid integration failure resulting in long-range regressions guided by active repair attempts.},

	Abstract = {Two classes of account have been proposed to explain the memory processes subserving the processing of reflexive-antecedent dependencies. Structure-based accounts assume that the retrieval of the antecedent is guided by syntactic tree-configurational information without considering other kinds of information such as gender marking in the case of English reflexives. By contrast, unconstrained cue-based retrieval assumes that all available information is used for retrieving the antecedent. Similarity-based interference effects from structurally illicit distractors which match a non-structural retrieval cue have been interpreted as evidence favoring the unconstrained cue-based retrieval account since cue-based retrieval interference from structurally illicit distractors is incompatible with the structure-based account. However, it has been argued that the observed effects do not necessarily reflect interference occurring at the moment of retrieval but might equally well be accounted for by interference occurring already at the stage of encoding or maintaining the antecedent in memory, in which case they cannot be taken as evidence against the structure-based account. We present three experiments (self-paced reading and eye-tracking) on German reflexives and Swedish reflexive and pronominal possessives in which we pit the predictions of encoding interference and cue-based retrieval interference against each other. We could not find any indication that encoding interference affects the processing ease of the reflexive-antecedent dependency formation. Thus, there is no evidence that encoding interference might be the explanation for the interference effects observed in previous work. We therefore conclude that invoking encoding interference may not be a plausible way to reconcile interference effects with a structure-based account of reflexive processing.},

We conducted an experiment to see if this correspondence also holds for oscillatory brain dynamics.

Such violations are known to elicit an N400, a negative-going deflection with a peak around 400 ms, and increased theta and gamma activity (Hagoort, Science, 2004). As expected, we see an N400 in the FRP and increased fixation durations and regression rates in the eye movement record. Moreover, a cluster-permutation test (Maris & Oostenveld, J Neurosci Methods, 2007) for fixation-related power spectra shows synchronization in the delta range (1-3 Hz) and desynchronization in the upper alpha range (11-13 Hz) but no theta or gamma effects. This is at odds with prior findings and suggests that fixation-related oscillatory EEG changes are not fully comparable to those observed in RSVP. One reason for the diverging results may lie in different processing demands: In RSVP, readers must retrieve earlier parts of the sentence from memory because they cannot make regressions.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies (Dimigen et al., JEP:G, 2011; Kretzschmar et al., NeuroReport, 2009) demonstrated the feasibility of investigating fixation-related potentials (FRPs) and that the results are similar to brain potentials recorded during rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). We conducted an experiment to assess if this correspondence also holds for rhythmic brain activity. To pit our results against results gained with RSVP, the experiment used sentences that are known to produce reliable effects both in the time domain and in the frequency domain (Hagoort, Science, 2004). Participants (N=48) read freely through true ("The Thames flows through London") and false statements ("The Hudson flows through London"). Hagoort et al. report an N400, a negative-going deflection in the ERP with a peak around 400 ms, as well as increased theta (4-7 Hz) and gamma (30-70 Hz) activity. During our experiment, participants' eye movements were monitored and their EEG was recorded from 32 electrodes and later evaluated contingent to the first fixation on the critical word. We analyzed the canonical eye-tracking measures with linear mixed-effects models and the EEG with cluster-permutation tests (Maris & Oostenveld, J Neurosci Methods, 2007) to control for multiple comparisons. As expected, we observed a negativity in the FRP with a centro-parietal distribution and a peak latency of approximately 400 ms. Also as expected, this N400 lined up with increased first fixation durations, gaze durations, and regression rates in the eye movement record (Dambacher & Kliegl, Brain Res, 2007). Crucially, fixation-related power spectra showed synchronization in the delta range (1-3 Hz) at central electrodes and desynchronization in the upper alpha range (11-13 Hz) at occipito-parietal sites relative to a pre-fixation baseline. None of these effects is reported by Hagoort et al. which suggests that fixation-related EEG changes are at least not fully comparable to those observed in RSVP. One reason for the diverging results could lie in different processing demands: In RSVP, readers must retrieve earlier parts of the sentence from working memory because they cannot make regressions. Increased theta activity reflects this more effortful memory access (Klimesch, Brain Res Rev, 1999). In natural reading, readers can easily move their eyes back to resolve the processing difficulty which facilitates memory access. Our findings question the comparability of results acquired with serial presentation vs. natural reading.},

	Abstract = {Traxler et al. (1998) found that ambiguous sentences are read faster than their unambiguous counterparts. This so-called ambiguity advantage has presented a major challenge to classical theories of human sentence comprehension (parsing) because its most prominent explanation, in the form of the unrestricted race model (URM), assumes that parsing is non-deterministic. Recently, Swets et al. (2008) have challenged the URM. They argue that readers strategically underspecify the representation of ambiguous sentences to save time, unless disambiguation is required by task demands. When disambiguation is required, however, readers assign sentences full structure --- and Swets et al. provide experimental evidence to this end. On the basis of their findings they argue against the URM and in favor of a model of task-dependent sentence comprehension.
We show through simulations that the Swets et al. data does not constitute evidence for task-dependent parsing because it can be explained by the URM. However, we provide decisive evidence from a German self-paced reading study consistent with Swets et al.'s general claim about task-dependent parsing. Specifically, we show that under certain conditions, ambiguous sentences can be read more slowly than their unambiguous counterparts, suggesting that the parser may create several parses, when required. Finally, we present the first quantitative model of task-driven disambiguation which subsumes the URM, and show that it can explain both Swets et al.'s results and our findings.},

@article{LogacevVasishthQJEP2016,
	Abstract = {Swets et al. (2008) present evidence that the so-called ambiguity advantage (Traxler et al., 1998), which has been explained in terms of the Unrestricted Race Model, can equally well be explained by assuming underspecification in ambiguous conditions driven by task-demands. Specifically, if comprehension questions require that ambiguities be resolved, the parser tends to make an attachment: when questions are about superficial aspects of the target sentence, readers tend to pursue an underspecification strategy. It is reasonable to assume that individual differences in strategy will play a significant role in the application of such strategies, so that studying average behavior may not be informative. In order to study the predictions of the good-enough processing theory, we implemented two versions of underspecification: the partial specification model (PSM), which is an implementation of the Swets et al. proposal, and a more parsimonious version, the non-specification model (NSM). We evaluate the relative fit of these two kinds of underspecification to Swets et al.'s data; as a baseline, we also fit three models that assume no underspecification. We find that a model without unspecification pro- vides a somewhat better fit than both underspecification models, while the NSM model provides a better fit than the PSM. We interpret the results as lack of unambiguous evidence in favor of underspecification; however, given that there is considerable existing evidence for good-enough processing in the literature, it is reasonable to assume that some underspecification might occur. Under this assumption, the results can be interpreted as tentative ev- idence for NSM over PSM. More generally, our work provides a method for choosing between models of real-time processes in sentence comprehension that make qualitative predictions about the relationship between several dependent variables. We believe that sentence processing research will greatly benefit from a wider use of such methods.},

	Abstract = {The psycholinguistic literature has identified two syntactic adaptation effects in language production: rapidly decaying short-term priming and long-lasting adaptation. To explain both effects, we present an ACT-R model of syntactic priming based on a wide-coverage, lexicalized syntactic theory that explains priming as facilitation of lexical access. In this model, two well-established ACT-R mechanisms, base-level learning and spreading activation, account for long-term adaptation and short-term priming, respectively. Our model simulates incremental language production and in a series of modeling studies we show that it accounts for (a)~the inverse frequency interaction; (b)~the absence of a decay in long-term priming; and (c)~the cumulativity of long-term adaptation. The model also explains the lexical boost effect and the fact that it only applies to short-term priming. We also present corpus data that verifies a prediction of the model, i.e., that the lexical boost affects all lexical material, rather than just heads.},

Our first experiment (n = 32) used RSVP and replicated both the N400 effect in the ERPs and the power increase in the theta range in the time--frequency domain. In the second experiment (n = 49), participants read the same materials freely while their eye movements and their EEG were monitored. First fixation durations, gaze durations, and regression rates were increased, and the ERP showed an N400 effect. An analysis of time--frequency representations showed synchronization in the delta range (1--3 Hz) and desynchronization in the upper alpha range (11--13 Hz) but no theta or gamma effects. The results suggest that oscillatory EEG changes elicited by world knowledge violations are different in natural reading and RSVP. This may reflect differences in how representations are constructed and retrieved from memory in the two presentation modes.},

	Abstract = {Pioneering work in reading research has shown that scanpaths in reading can be informative about sentences processing (Frazier, Rayner, 1982). Nevertheless, scanpaths have not gained much traction in reading research. One reason for that may have been a lack of suitable analytical tools. Here, we summarize three recent studies in which we used a new scanpath measure to analyze gaze data from two experimental studies (von der Malsburg, Vasishth, 2011, 2012) and one corpus study (von der Malsburg, Kliegl, Vasishth, under revision). The experiments investigated how readers process temporarily ambiguous sentences. We showed that readers do not always commit to one of the alternative interpretations, and that readers with low working-memory capacity do so less often. Contrary to what was reported earlier, we found that reparsing instead of targeted repair is a common strategy to recover from incorrect interpretations. Interestingly, these results did not emerge in an analysis using traditional word-based eyetracking measures showing their limitations. In the corpus study, we demonstrated how syntax, oculomotor constraints, and age of reader jointly determine the regularity of scanpaths. We argue that, taken together, these results establish the scanpath as an informative and tractable object of investigation in reading research.},

	Abstract = {Recent research demonstrated the feasibility of analyzing fixation-related brain potentials (FRPs) recorded during natural reading (Kretzschmar et al., 2009; Dimigen et al., 2011). Two questions arise from these studies: (1) Are effects observed with fixation-triggered EEG signals comparable to those observed in standard RSVP designs? (2) Does the combined analysis of EEG and fixation data provide additional insights into reading and comprehension processes that are not available with either method alone? Both above-mentioned studies used material known to robustly elicit strong N400 effects. The present study (N=50) examined responses to a more subtle manipulation representative of common experimental designs: we manipulated the distance between anaphoric expressions (pronouns, verb ellipsis) and their antecedents. Differences were examined using a non-parametric Monte Carlo test (Maris & Oostenveld, 2007). Increased distance of the antecedent elicited an early frontocentral negativity in response to verb ellipses (88ms-134ms, p<0.001) and a negativity at frontocentral and parietal electrodes on the words following pronouns (98ms-186ms, p<0.001). We discuss these results in the context of earlier findings and argue that adopting FRP-methodology requires factoring in complex visuomotor contingencies that are not yet fully understood and that evoke ERP effects different from those seen in RSVP designs.},

	Abstract = {Recent research (Dimigen et al., JEP:G, 2011; Kretzschmar et al., NeuroReport, 2009) shows that fixation-related potentials (FRPs) yield similar results as brain potentials recorded during rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). We conducted an experiment to see if this correspondence also holds for oscillatory brain dynamics. Participants (N=48) read true ("The Thames flows through London") and false factual statements ("The Hudson flows through London"). Such violations are known to elicit an N400, a negative-going deflection with a peak around 400 ms, and increased theta and gamma activity (Hagoort, Science, 2004). As expected, we see an N400 in the FRP and increased fixation durations and regression rates in the eye movement record. Moreover, a cluster-permutation test (Maris & Oostenveld, J Neurosci Methods, 2007) for fixation-related power spectra shows synchronization in the delta range (1-3 Hz) and desynchronization in the upper alpha range (11-13 Hz) but no theta or gamma effects. This is at odds with prior findings and suggests that fixation-related oscillatory EEG changes are not fully comparable to those observed in RSVP. One reason for the diverging results may lie in different processing demands: In RSVP, readers must retrieve earlier parts of the sentence from memory because they cannot make regressions.},

@article{NicenboimEtAl2015article,
	Abstract = {There is a wealth of evidence showing that increasing the distance between an argument and its head leads to more processing effort, namely, locality effects; these are usually associated with constraints in working memory (DLT: Gibson, 2000; activation-based model: Lewis and Vasishth, 2005). In SOV languages, however, the opposite effect has been found: antilocality (see discussion in Levy et al., 2013). Antilocality effects can be explained by the expectation-based approach as proposed by Levy (2008) or by the activation-based model of sentence processing as proposed by Lewis and Vasishth (2005). We report an eye-tracking and a self-paced reading study with sentences in Spanish together with measures of individual differences to examine the distinction between expectation- and memory-based accounts, and within memory-based accounts the further distinction between DLT and the activation-based model. The experiments show that (i) antilocality effects as predicted by the expectation account appear only for high-capacity readers; (ii) increasing dependency length by interposing material that modifies the head of the dependency (the verb) produces stronger facilitation than increasing dependency length with material that does not modify the head; this is in agreement with the activation-based model but not with the expectation account; and (iii) a possible outcome of memory load on low-capacity readers is the increase in regressive saccades (locality effects as predicted by memory-based accounts) or, surprisingly, a speedup in the self-paced reading task; the latter consistent with good-enough parsing (Ferreira et al., 2002). In sum, the study suggests that individual differences in working memory capacity play a role in dependency resolution, and that some of the aspects of dependency resolution can be best explained with the activation-based model together with a prediction component.},

	Abstract = {In this chapter, we focus on a previously ignored aspect of sentence processing theories: is processing difficulty caused by reanalysis or competition? According to two-stage theories (e.g., Frazier, 1979; Rayner, Frazier, \{\&\} Carlson, 1983), reanalysis should occur when an initially adopted reading is inappropriate. In contrast, current constraint-based theories (e.g., MacDonald, 1994; McRae, Spivey-Knowlton, \{\&\} Tanenhaus, 1998) claim that processing difficulty is due to a competition between two or more syntactic analyses that are about equally activated. We review a number of eye-tracking experiments investigating this issue. No competition was observed in any of the experiments, thus ruling out current constraint-based theories. In fact, the opposite pattern emerged: sentences that should have produced processing difficulty according to constraint-based theories were actually easier to process than sentences that should not have produced difficulty. The data also turn out to be problematic for two-stage theories, as non-syntactic information appears to be employed before the point of reanalysis. The data provide evidence for a new model of syntactic ambiguity resolution (cf. Traxler, Pickering, \{\&\} Clifton, 1998; Van Gompel, Pickering, \{\&\} Traxler, 1999), the unrestricted race model. In this model, processing difficulty is due to reanalysis, but multiple sources of information can determine which analysis is initially adopted.},

Since both (weak and strong) GPs are supposed to have more than 50\% reanalysis cases (at least according to Gompel, Pickering \{\&\} Traxler) - these upper 50\% should have roughly the same distribution in strong and weak garden paths.

	Abstract = {An English double-embedded relative clause from which the middle verb is omitted can often be processed more easily than its grammatical counterpart, a phenomenon known as the grammaticality illusion. This effect has been found to be reversed in German, suggesting that the illusion is language specific rather than a consequence of universal working memory constraints. We present results from three self-paced reading experiments which show that Dutch native speakers also do not show the grammaticality illusion in Dutch, whereas both German and Dutch native speakers do show the illusion when reading English sentences. These findings provide evidence against working memory constraints as an explanation for the observed effect in English. We propose an alternative account based on the statistical patterns of the languages involved. In support of this alternative, a single recurrent neural network model that is trained on both Dutch and English sentences indeed predicts the cross-linguistic difference in grammaticality effect.},

	Abstract = {In explicit memory recall and recognition tasks, elaboration and contextual isolation both facilitate memory performance. Here, we investigate these effects in the context of sentence processing: targets for retrieval during online sentence processing of English object relative clause constructions differ in the amount of elaboration associated with the target noun phrase, or the homogeneity of superficial features (text color). Experiment 1 shows that greater elaboration for targets during the encoding phase reduces reading times at retrieval sites, but elaboration of non-targets has considerably weaker effects. Experiment 2 illustrates that processing isolated superficial features of target noun phrases---here, a green word in a sentence with words colored white---does not lead to enhanced memory performance, despite triggering longer encoding times. These results are interpreted in the light of the memory models of Nairne, 1990, 2001, 2006, which state that encoding remnants contribute to the set of retrieval cues that provide the basis for similarity-based interference effects.},

	Abstract = {Expectation-driven facilitation (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008) and locality-driven retrieval difficulty (Gibson, 1998, 2000; Lewis &
Vasishth, 2005) are widely recognized to be two critical factors in incremental sentence processing; there is accumulating
evidence that both can influence processing difficulty. However, it is unclear whether and how expectations and memory
interact. We first confirm a key prediction of the expectation account: a Hindi self-paced reading study shows that when an
expectation for an upcoming part of speech is dashed, building a rarer structure consumes more processing time than
building a less rare structure. This is a strong validation of the expectation-based account. In a second study, we show that
when expectation is strong, i.e., when a particular verb is predicted, strong facilitation effects are seen when the appearance
of the verb is delayed; however, when expectation is weak, i.e., when only the part of speech ``verb'' is predicted but a
particular verb is not predicted, the facilitation disappears and a tendency towards a locality effect is seen. The interaction
seen between expectation strength and distance shows that strong expectations cancel locality effects, and that weak
expectations allow locality effects to emerge.},

	Abstract = {Comprehension of non-canonical sentences can be difficult for individuals with aphasia (IWA). It is still unclear to which extent morphological cues like case-marking or verb inflection may influence IWA's performance or even help to override deficits in sentence comprehension. Until now, studies have mainly used offline methods to draw inferences about syntactic deficits and, so far, only a few studies have looked at online syntactic processing in aphasia. We investigated sentence processing in German IWA by combining an offline (sentence-picture matching) and online (eye-tracking in the visual-world paradigm) method. Our goal was to determine whether IWA are capable of using inflectional morphology (number-agreement markers on verbs and case markers in noun phrases) as a cue to sentence interpretation. We report results of two visual-world experiments using German reversible SVO and OVS sentences. In each study, there were eight IWA and 20 age-matched controls. Experiment 1 targeted the role of case-morphology, while Experiment 2 looked at processing of number-agreement cues at the verb in case-ambiguous sentences. IWA showed deficits in using both types of morphological markers as a cue to non-canonical sentence interpretation and the results indicate that in aphasia, processing of case-marking cues is more vulnerable as compared to verb-agreement morphology. However, the online data revealed that IWA are in principle capable of successfully computing morphological cues, but the integration of morphological information is delayed as compared to age-matched controls. Furthermore, we found striking differences between controls and IWA regarding subject-before-object parsing predictions. While in case-unambiguous sentences IWA showed evidence for early subject-before-object parsing commitments, they exhibited no straightforward subject-first bias in case-ambiguous sentences, although controls did so for ambiguous structures. IWA delayed their parsing decisions in case-ambiguous sentences until unambiguous morphological information, such as a subject-verb-number-agreement cue, was available. We attribute the differential results for processing of case and agreement markers to differences in the degree of reliability of both morphological cues. We ascribe our findings for erroneous processing of case-unambiguous sentences in aphasia to late parsing commitments and failures in integrating case cues on time. For processing of case-ambiguous sentences in aphasia, we suggest that IWA adopt a wait-and-see strategy and make parsing commitments only when the agreement cue at the verb prompts a particular sentence structure. Our results for IWA further point to deficits in predictive processes during sentence comprehension.},

	Abstract = {We examined the effects of argument-head distance in SVO and SOV languages (Spanish and German), while taking into account readers' working memory capacity and controlling for expectation (Levy, 2008) and other factors. We predicted only locality effects, that is, a slow-down produced by increased dependency distance (Gibson, 2000; Lewis & Vasishth, 2005). Furthermore, we expected stronger locality effects for readers with low working memory capacity. Contrary to our predictions, low-capacity readers showed faster reading with increased distance, while high-capacity readers showed locality effects. We suggest that while the locality effects are compatible with memory-based explanations, the speedup of low-capacity readers can be explained by an increased probability of retrieval failure. We present a computational model based on ACT-R built under the previous assumptions, which is able to give a qualitative account for the present data and can be tested in future research. Our results suggest that in some cases, interpreting longer RTs as indexing increased processing difficulty and shorter RTs as facilitation may be too simplistic: The same increase in processing difficulty may lead to slowdowns in high-capacity readers and speedups in low-capacity ones.

	Abstract = {How important is the ability to freely control eye
  movements for reading comprehension? And how does the parser make use
  of this freedom? We investigated these questions using coregistration
  of eye movements and event-related brain potentials (ERPs) while
  participants read either freely or in a computer-controlled
  word-by-word format (also known as RSVP). Word-by-word presentation
  and natural reading both elicited qualitatively similar ERP effects in
  response to syntactic and semantic violations (N400 and P600
  effects). Comprehension was better in free reading but only in trials
  in which the eyes regressed to previous material upon encountering the
  anomaly. A more fine-grained ERP analysis revealed that these
  regressions were strongly associated with the well-known P600
  effect. In trials without regressions, we instead found sustained
  centro-parietal negativities starting at around 320 ms post-onset;
  however, these negativities were only found when the violation
  occurred in sentence-final position. Taken together, these results
  suggest that the sentence processing system engages in strategic
  choices: In response to words that don't match built-up expectations,
  it can either explore alternative interpretations (reflected by
  regressions, P600 effects, and good comprehension) or pursue a
  ``good-enough'' processing strategy that tolerates a deficient
  interpretation (reflected by progressive saccades, sustained
  negativities, and relatively poor comprehension).},

@article{HanneEtAl2015,
	Abstract = {{\textit{Background}}: Individuals with aphasia (IWA) show deficits in comprehending object-extracted declaratives while comprehension of subject-extracted structures is relatively preserved. It is a matter of debate whether this subject--object asymmetry also arises for comprehension of wh-questions. Successful comprehension of wh-questions critically entails correct resolution of a filler--gap dependency. Most previous studies have used only offline accuracy measures to investigate wh-question comprehension in aphasia. Online studies exploring syntactic processing in real time are needed in order to draw inferences about gap-filling abilities in IWA and to identify the point of breakdown in sentence comprehension.
Aims: This study aimed at investigating processing of subject and object who-questions in German-speaking IWA and in a group of controls by combining an offline and online method. We further aimed to explore the impact of case-marking cues on processing of wh-questions.
Methods & Procedures: Applying a variant of the visual world eye-tracking paradigm, we measured participants' eye movements while they performed the same offline task, which is frequently used to assess comprehension of declaratives (sentence--picture matching).
Outcomes & Results: Concerning online processing of who-questions in controls, we found anticipation of the most likely post-verbal theta-role immediately after processing the case-marked wh-pronoun in both subject and object questions. In addition, we observed an unexpected advantage of object over subject questions in terms of processing time. The offline results for IWA revealed that there were three heterogeneous patterns: (a) symmetrical comprehension with equal impairments for both question types, (b) asymmetrical performance with better comprehension of subject than object who-questions, and (c) a reversed asymmetry with better comprehension of object as compared to subject questions. For online processing of both types of who-questions, IWA showed retained abilities in postulating the gap and in associating the filler with this gap, although they were slower as compared to controls. Moreover, similarly to controls, they anticipated the most likely post-verbal theta-role.
Conclusions: For controls, the findings provide evidence for rapid resolution of the filler--gap dependency and incremental processing of case-marking cues, reflected in early prediction of upcoming syntactic structure. We attribute faster processing of object questions to faster alignment of the anticipated element with a semantically more salient character. For IWA, the online data provide evidence for retained predictive abilities in processing of filler--gap dependencies in wh-questions, but prediction was delayed. This is most likely attributed to delayed integration of case-marking cues.},

	Abstract = {SOPARSE (Tabor \& Hutchins, 2004) predicts so-called local coherence effects: locally plausible but globally impossible parses of substrings can exert a distracting influence during sentence processing. Additionally, it predicts digging-in effects: the longer the parser stays committed to a particular analysis, the harder it becomes to inhibit that analysis. We investigated the interaction of these two predictions using German sentences. Results from a self-paced reading study show that the processing difficulty caused by a local coherence can be reduced by first allowing the globally correct parse to become entrenched, which supports SOPARSE's assumptions.},

@article{HusainVasishthNarayanan2015,
	Abstract = {This is the first attempt at characterizing reading difficulty in Hindi using naturally occurring sentences. We created the Potsdam-Allahabad Hindi Eyetracking Corpus by recording eye-movement data from 30 participants at the University of Allahabad, India. The target stimuli were 153 sentences selected from the beta version of the Hindi-Urdu treebank. We find that word- or low-level predictors (syllable length, unigram and bigram frequency) affect first-pass reading times, regression path duration, total reading time, and outgoing saccade length. An increase in syllable length results in longer fixations, and an increase in word unigram and bigram frequency leads to shorter fixations. Longer syllable length and higher frequency lead to longer outgoing saccades. We also find that two predictors of sentence comprehension diffi- culty, integration and storage cost, have an effect on reading difficulty. Integration cost (Gibson, 2000) was approximated by calculating the distance (in words) between a dependent and head; and storage cost (Gibson, 2000), which measures difficulty of maintaining predictions, was estimated by counting the number of predicted heads at each point in the sentence. We find that integration cost mainly affects outgoing saccade length, and storage cost affects total reading times and outgoing saccade length. Thus, word-level predictors have an effect in both early and late measures of reading time, while predictors of sentence comprehension difficulty tend to affect later measures. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration using eye-tracking that both integration and storage cost influence reading difficulty.},

	Abstract = {The analysis of experimental data with mixed-effects models requires
decisions about the specification of the appropriate random-effects structure.
Recently, Barr, et al 2013, recommended  fitting `maximal'
models with all possible random effect components included.  Estimation of
maximal models, however, may not converge.  We show that failure to converge
 typically is not due to a suboptimal estimation algorithm, but is
a consequence of attempting to fit a model that is too complex to be properly
supported by the data, irrespective of whether estimation is based on maximum
likelihood or on Bayesian hierarchical modeling with uninformative or weakly
informative priors.  Importantly, even under convergence, overparameterization
may lead to uninterpretable models.  We provide diagnostic tools for detecting
overparameterization and guiding model simplification.  Finally, we clarify
that the simulations on which Barr et al. base their recommendations are
atypical for real data.  A detailed example is provided of how subject-related
attentional fluctuation across trials may further qualify
statistical inferences about fixed effects, and of how such nonlinear effects
can be accommodated within the mixed-effects modeling framework.},

	Abstract = {We show that publishing results using the statistical significance filter---publishing only when the p-value is less than 0.05---leads to a vicious cycle of overoptimistic expectation of the replicability of results.
First, we show analytically that when true statistical power is relatively low, computing power based on statistically significant results will lead to overestimates of power. Then, we present a case study using 10 experimental comparisons drawn from a recently published meta-analysis in psycholinguistics (J\"ager et al., 2017). We show that the statistically significant results yield an illusion of replicability.  This illusion holds even if the researcher doesn't conduct any formal power analysis but just uses statistical significance to informally assess robustness (i.e., replicability) of results.},

	Abstract = {Treating a result as newsworthy, i.e., publishable, because the p-value is less than 0.05 leads to overoptimistic expectations of replicability. The underlying cause of these overoptimistic expectations is Type M(agnitude) error (Gelman & Carlin, 2014): when underpowered studies yield significant results, the effect size estimates are invariably exaggerated and noisy. Here, we demonstrate the adverse consequences of this statistical significance filter. We do this by carrying out direct replication attempts of published results from a recent paper. Six experiments (self-paced reading and eyetracking, 168 participants in total) show that the published (statistically significant) claims are so noisy that even non-significant results are fully compatible with them. We also demonstrate the stark contrast between these small-sample studies and a larger-sample study (100 participants); the latter yields much less noisy estimates but also a much smaller magnitude of the effect of interest. The small magnitude looks less compelling but is more realistic. We suggest that researchers (i) move their focus away from statistical significance, (ii) attend instead to the precision of their estimates, and (iii) carry out direct replications in order to demonstrate the existence of an effect.},

@unpublished{VasishthMixture2017,
	Abstract = {We present a case study demonstrating the importance of Bayesian hierarchical mixture models as a modelling tool for evaluating the predictions of competing theories of cognitive processes. As a case study, we revisit two published data sets from psycholinguistics.
In sentence comprehension, it is widely assumed that the distance between linguistic co-dependents affects the latency of dependency resolution: the longer the distance, the longer the time taken to complete the dependency (e.g., Gibson 2000). An alternative theory, direct access (McElree, 1993), assumes that retrieval times are a mixture of two distributions (Nicenboim & Vasishth, 2017): one distribution represents successful retrievals and the other represents an initial failure to retrieve the correct dependent, followed by a reanalysis that leads to successful retrieval. Here, dependency distance has the effect that in long-distance conditions the proportion of reanalyses is higher. We implement both theories as Bayesian hierarchical models and show that the direct-access model fits the Chinese relative clause reading time data better than the dependency-distance account.
This work makes several novel contributions.
First, we demonstrate how the researcher can reason about the underlying generative process of their data, thereby expressing the underlying cognitive process as a statistical model.
Second, we show how models that have been developed in an exploratory manner to represent different underlying generative processes can be compared in terms of their predictive performance, using both K-fold cross validation on existing data, and using completely new data. Finally, we show how the models can be evaluated using simulated data.},

@inproceedings{VasishthEtAlICCM2017,
	Abstract = {The ungrammatical sentence "The key to the cabinets are on the table" is known to lead to an illusion of grammaticality. As discussed in the meta-analysis by Jaeger et al., 2017, faster reading times are observed at the verb are in the agreement-attraction sentence above compared to the equally ungrammatical sentence "The key to the cabinet are on the table". One explanation for this facilitation effect is the feature percolation account: the plural feature on cabinets percolates up to the head noun key, leading to the illusion. An alternative account is in terms of cue-based retrieval (Lewis & Vasishth, 2005), which assumes that the non-subject noun cabinets is misretrieved due to a partial feature-match when a dependency completion process at the auxiliary initiates a memory access for a subject with plural marking. We present evidence for yet another explanation for the observed facilitation. Because the second sentence has two nouns with identical number, it is possible that these are, in some proportion of trials, more difficult to keep distinct, leading to slower reading times at the verb in the first sentence above; this is the feature overwriting account of Nairne, 1990. We show that the feature overwriting proposal can be implemented as a finite mixture process. We reanalysed ten published data-sets, fitting hierarchical Bayesian mixture models to these data assuming a two-mixture distribution. We show that in nine out of the ten studies, a mixture distribution corresponding to feature overwriting furnishes a superior fit over both the feature percolation and the cue-based retrieval accounts.},
